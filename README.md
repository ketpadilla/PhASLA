<!--- Description ---> 
_Physics and Solution Learning Assistant_ (PhASLA) is a website with free-to-access worksheets for mathematical physics for Mapúa University students taking the General Physics 1 course. It primarly prompts users to a selection of physics topics, ranging from easy to hard word problems, so that they may answer and learn how to apply phyisics theoreticals and formulas.


Currently, the website is currently a working prototype as a proof of concept to its potential. As of July 2023, it only provides two (2) topics; each with five (5) easy and standard-level questions. It is an understatement for me to say that I had quite a challenge when implement all of its core features——especially with all the bugs that needed to be fixed and optimizations that needed to be done.


This is the 2nd version of PhASLA; designed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=07ccb8ff67155b3c3c27b8dda3ef9083&position=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete">_CS50_<a> (Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science). The 1st version was designed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for our <a href="ketpadilla.github.io/MGT03-website/">_MGT03_<a> (Entrepreneurship) in Mapúa University. However, it is practically unusable and you are better off checking out this version instead. As I was taking both CS50 and MGT03 at the same time, I thought it would be efficient to create one final project for both courses——that's why we are here.

After publishing this version of PhASLA online _(whenever may that be)_, I don't plan on updating or maintaing the website anytime soon. However, in the future, I plan on going back to this project and creating newer versions after I am more confident with my knowledge and skills. I hope to overhaul the way it produces word problems so that it dynamically changes difficulty and applies various ways to solve the problems. I also want users to be able to create their accounts on the website so they can save their scores and progress. Which means I'll have to properly setup an online database _(look forward to my 2nd project if I haven't linked it here)_. So, I'll have to learn and do a lot of stuff before anything happens.


For now, I'll make a toast <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QZnShCmz0a1NZ1qUHl/giphy.gif" width="15"> to my first ever _(proper)_ project!
